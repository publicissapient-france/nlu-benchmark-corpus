Also note that if you got real time stats hidden (under privacy settings) you have to enable it for this to work.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can now find the exported tracks in the same directory as the script.

It is free and quite easy to get such an account. Once you have an account you can backuo Last.fm loved tracks to a CSV file by first a creating an empty file and then issuing the following</p>\n\n<pre><code>sync_songs sync --color -vs smith:lastfm:loved file_path:csv:library\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You need to replace <code>smith</code> with your Last.fm user name and <code>file_path</code> with the path to the empty file.</p>\n",

As you stated, \"webcam\" was one that attracted the bots. Mention of various Apple Computer product names is one that I've seen attract the bots in full force.</p>\n\n<p>When your public tweet brings your Twitter account to the attention of the spambots, they will react. One of the ways in which they react is to reply to your tweet or to \"mention\" you.</p>\n\n<p>You post something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"My new remote controlled helicopter arrives tomorrow! Hooray!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the spambots respond with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@your-twitter-account I know, right? i got mine today from (some spam\n  link)</p>\n  \n  <p>@your-twitter-account FREE HELICOPTER FOR THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE (some\n  spam link)</p>\n  \n  <p>Hey, I think @your-twitter-account is loving his new remote from (some\n  spam link)</p>\n  \n  <p>@your-twitter-acocunt @someone-else #trendinghashtag (spam link) i\n  blah bloop bleep</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Echofon asks Twitter for a list of your \"mentions\" and/or \"interactions\", the tweets from the spam bots are included in the list. Echofon then notifies you of these tweets.</p>\n\n<p>In a world without spam, this is useful behavior. It facilitates conversations with new people who you might not have otherwise interacted with.</p>\n\n<p>Echofon for iOS recently (<a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/changes/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">as of May 8, 2012</a>) gained a new feature: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Refine push notification settings\n  <ul>\n  <li>Added an option receiving mentions notification only from people you follow</li>\n  </ul></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Echofon <a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/changes/windows\" rel=\"nofollow\">for Windows</a> and <a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/changes/firefox\" rel=\"nofollow\">for Firefox</a> do not seem to have such a feature yet.</p>\n\n<p>You could request the feature be added to Echofon, you could tolerate the occasional spam notifications (and report/block the accounts), or you could find another Twitter client that has a feature to suppress notification of mentions from accounts you do not follow.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck!</p>\n",

AFAIK, conversations are best done with IM (e.g. MSN, ICQ, Gtalk, AIM, !Y, or IRC (for groups)), Facebook chat, or Google Wave (for collaboration)... and/or SMS on mobile phones.</p>\n\n<p>FYI: If you just want to track a Twitter conversation between 2 parties, bettween.com offers a unique view for this. e.g. here is the current 'conversation' between <a href=\"http://bettween.com/kevinrose/alexalbrecht\" rel=\"nofollow\">@KevinRose/@AlexAlbrecht</a>.</p>\n",

Mint was just purchased by Intiut so they probably haven't had time to get Canada integration since Mint was a smaller company.  I would try the Intuit one first as they are such a large and old org that if they don't support Canada then no one probably does.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Wesabe.com would have been another option but they have closed down as of this month.</p>\n",
