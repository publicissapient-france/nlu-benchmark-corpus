The essence is that instead of importing the calendar, you add the URL of your event feed as a public calendar - here's a summary of the steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In Facebook click on \"Events\"</li>\n<li>Click on \"Export Events\" and copy the URL</li>\n<li>In Google Calendar go to \"Add\" under \"Other calendars\" and choose \"Add by URL\"</li>\n<li>Paste the URL you copied from Facebook and click \"Add\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[Update: to make answer more complete]<br>\nIf you run into issues with private events not showing properly then check out <a href=\"http://eventbusyfix.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eventbusyfix.info</a>.

By using this, you could have Foursquare update both facebook and twitter without the tweet again updating facebook; and then for normal tweets that you want to push into facebook, include \"#fb\". It costs you a few characters, but it accomplishes your goal.</p>\n",

We recommend using only\n  Gmail's spam filtering and turning off any additional anti-spam or\n  junk mail filters within your client. If you still decide to enable\n  client side spam filtering, your client will download an extra copy of\n  every message.</p>\n  \n  <p><sub>*IMAP: IMAP (Internet message access protocol) lets you download\n  messages from Gmail so you can access your mail with a program like\n  Outlook Express or Apple Mail.

A token is any sequence of alphanumeric characters separated by a space or by other non-alphanumeric characters such as underscore, full stop (period), \"@\", dash, etc.. So in peter.ford23@example.com there are 4 tokens: \"peter\", \"ford23\", \"example\" and \"com\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Wildcards within tokens do not work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Gmail only searches by words or parts of emails. Even the <code>.</code> in the examples below may be unnecessary (<code>from:.ru</code> may be the same as <code>from:ru</code>)</p>\n\n<p>Or something like <code>from:.ru</code> should match all messages whose from address contains .ru (I tested <code>from:(.com)</code> that matches anything.com addresses, while <code>from:(.co)</code> matches emails <strong>containing</strong> .co like <code>@yahoo.co.uk</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There may be a combination of \"tokens\"/words in the <code>from:</code>, <code>subject:</code>,<code>body:</code> that might match enough messages...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There <em>used to be</em> a good language search, but apparently it doesn't work anymore. <a href=\"http://www.labnol.org/internet/gmail-language-filter-reduces-spam/9000/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This guy said</a> that Gmail could search emails by language using <code>lang:[code]</code>, like <code>lang:ru</code> for Russian. More <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/using_rest#language-params\" rel=\"nofollow\">language codes should be here</a>. I don't think I have any emails like that so couldn't test, but trying <code>lang:en</code> didn't show any hits, so it looks like it's no longer available.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Or, you could try a filter for the \"false positive\" spam you frequently see and keep those out of the spam folder, maybe search for your name or something unique?
