      "text": "<p>You can always download 13.04 iso image and try the live environment and see if you like it. There is no objective answer I suppose. </p>\n\n<p>Of course you should certainly upgrade before the support ends and for 12.04 it means before April 2017. One reason to upgrade would be that as Ubuntu is coming to phones and tablets it must become more resource efficient. As people claim 13.04 delivers notable improvements in that sense. That means, it is likely to do the same tasks faster.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if your not an enthusiast who just enjoys new things and don't care if they don't work then it makes sense to wait before moving to new release. After first few months there is hope that most critical bugs have been revealed and fixed. </p>\n\n<p>I am using 12.04 myself and really wondering whether it is worth the trouble of upgrading to 13.04. Even if you use the release upgrade feature it makes sense to make backups as things might go wrong (as you can read from various questions here) and the whole process takes time and effort. So maybe wait for 14.04 and upgrade next summer. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand if your current system has any chronic problems you might want to try if those have been fixed in the newer release.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: I upgraded to 13.04 and yes it is faster as everybody have been telling me.</p>\n",

      "text": "<h2>Bash Arithmetic</h2>\n\n<p>Another possible solution is to add a simple function for Bash's builtin arithmetic. Put this in your <code>.bashrc</code> file to try:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    echo \"$(($@))\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now, you don't even need <code>$((...))</code> anymore, just <code>=</code> which seems natural enough.</p>\n\n<h3>Replacement</h3>\n\n<p>Another thing if you want to be even faster: you can make it replace <code>p</code> with <code>+</code> and <code>x</code> with <code>*</code>. This will work for that:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    calc=\"${@//p/+}\"\n    calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\n    echo \"$(($calc))\"\n}\n\n= 5 x 5  # Returns 25\n= 50p25  # Returns 75\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you don't even need <kbd>Shift</kbd> anymore, the only thing is <code>=&nbsp;</code> in front of arithmetic.</p>\n\n<h3>Hexadecimal output</h3>\n\n<p>Output can be displayed in both decimal and hexadecimal, if so desired. (<strong>Note</strong>: using <code>x</code> substitution will conflict with the <code>0x...</code> hex syntax)</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    answer=\"$(($@))\"\n    printf '%s' \"$answer\"\n    bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt; \"obase=16;ans=$answer;print \\\" (0x\\\",ans,\\\")\\\\n\\\"\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(uses Bash for arithmetic, but bc for final decimal to hex conversion)</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>$ = 16 + 0x10\n272 (0x110)\n\n$ = 16**3 + 16**4\n69632 (0x11000)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Using bc</h2>\n\n<p>If you want slightly more advanced calculations, you can pipe it to <code>bc</code> like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    calc=\"${@//p/+}\"\n    calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\n    bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt;\"scale=10;$calc\"\n}\n\n= 'sqrt(2)' # Returns 1.4142135623\n= '4*a(1)'  # Returns pi (3.1415926532)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The functions provided by <code>bc</code> are as follows (and can be found from <code>man bc</code>):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sqrt ( expression )\n       The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the expression.  \n       If the expression is negative, a run time error is generated.\n\ns (x)  The sine of x, x is in radians.\n\nc (x)  The cosine of x, x is in radians.\n\na (x)  The arctangent of x, arctangent returns radians.\n\nl (x)  The natural logarithm of x.\n\ne (x)  The exponential function of raising e to the value x.\n\nj (n,x)\n       The Bessel function of integer order n of x.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It also supports <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> and variables like a programming language though if it may be better to write to a file if you wanted that.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that it will substitute <code>p</code> and <code>x</code> in function/variable names. It may be better to just remove the replacements.</p>\n\n<h2>Using gcalccmd</h2>\n\n<p>You can also make the function call <code>gcalccmd</code> (from <code>gnome-calculator</code>) like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    calc=\"$@\"\n    # Uncomment the below for (p → +) and (x → *)\n    #calc=\"${calc//p/+}\"\n    #calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\n    echo -ne \"$calc\\n quit\" | gcalccmd | sed 's:^&gt; ::g'\n}\n\n= 'sqrt(2)' # Returns 1.4142135623\n= '4^4'     # Returns 256\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The available functions seem to be (taken straight from <a href=\"http://sourcecodebrowser.com/gcalctool/5.29.2/mp-equation_8c.html#a2c1b83394ed2fe6da08e1538b65fd29b\">the source code</a>), <code>==</code> denotes equivalent functions:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>ln()\nsqrt()\nabs()\nint()\nfrac()\nsin()\ncos()\ntan()\nsin⁻¹() == asin()\ncos⁻¹() == acos()\ntan⁻¹() == atan()\nsinh()\ncosh()\ntanh()\nsinh⁻¹() == asinh()\ncosh⁻¹() == acosh()\ntanh⁻¹() == atanh()\nones()\ntwos()\n</code></pre>\n",

It manages your ebook collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book, i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to ebooks in several formats. It also upports conversion from a dozen different ebook formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.</p>\n\n<p>Supported input formats are: MOBI, AZW, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Starting calibre's ebook viewer as a standalone application</strong></p>\n\n<p>In certain cases you will not want to add an epub or mobi file to calibre's library before reading it. Luckily calibre's ebook viewer can be started independently via <code>ebook-viewer</code>. This makes it possible to create a standalone launcher:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=calibre\nExec=ebook-viewer %f\nName=Ebook Viewer\nComment=Display .epub files and other e-reader formats\nStartupWMClass=ebook-viewer\nMimeType=application/x-mobipocket-ebook;application/epub+zip;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/13758/how-can-i-edit-create-new-launcher-items-in-unity-by-hand\">here</a> for more information on adding launchers to your system.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>To click an ebook and open in ebook-viewer</strong>, make this application (<code>usr/bin/ebook-viewer</code>) the default for that type of file. </p>\n",

      "text": "<p>From the MAN PAGES:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shutdown</strong> - \"shutdown arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way.  All\n       logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and,  within\n       the last five minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented.\" Time mentioned here is an amount specify by the user that is shutting down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Halt</strong> - \"These programs allow a system administrator to reboot, halt or poweroff\n       the system.\"</p>\n\n<p>The difference is that Halt can be more \"aggressive\" when shutting down than Shutdown itself. It has parameters than can literally force the system to shutdown without regarding services or opened programs. If you run halt without any parameters it will simply execute the shutdown command. Something like an alias. If you run it for example with the parameter <code>--force</code> it will \"force\" the system into a reboot really fast.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of halt or shutdown, they will wait for all processes to finish correctly before turning the PC off or rebooting. If a service or app does not close or does not close properly you will see what you mention there (The ubuntu logo with the dots).</p>\n\n<p>The proper way in the terminal for a single user or multi user is shutdown. But if the shutdown is not working verify what services you have running and which one is causing the slowness or freezing of the shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, there are several ways to reboot or shutdown the system:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rebooting</strong> - <code>shutdown -r</code>, <code>reboot</code></p>\n\n<p>In this case, reboot is simply calling <code>shutdown -r</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shutting Down</strong> - <code>halt</code>, <code>shutdown</code>, <code>sudo init 0</code>, <code>shutdown -h now</code>, <code>poweroff</code></p>\n\n<p>In this case, <code>poweroff</code> is the same as calling <code>shutdown -P</code></p>\n\n<p>As you have noticed, The <code>shutdown</code> command can do a lot of stuff, here is a small list of it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-r  Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down\n-h  Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system\n-H  Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down\n-P  Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down\n-c  Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this option, the first argument is MESSAGE\n-k  Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually bring the system down\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As does the <code>reboot</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>-f, --force                 force reboot or halt, don't call shutdown(8)\n-p, --poweroff              switch off the power when called as halt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is however a difference between shutdown down through the terminal and clicking on the Shutdown option in Unity. The latter will ask the user for interaction with any unsaved work (like libreoffice, inkscape...). the former will simply send a signal to all processes telling them to close. No user interaction will be needed so any unsaved work will be gone.</p>\n",

Note that it has a big bundle of dependencies. You can also go ahead and ask a question here on how to set a keyboard shortcut that doesn't depend on gnome running. </p>\n\n<p>There <em>is</em> a keyboard shortcut to shut down your system that is available all of the time, but it's rather tedious and complicated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>SysRq</kbd>+(<kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>E</kbd>, <kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>U</kbd>, <kbd>O</kbd>).</p>\n\n<p>That is, hold down alt and sysrq, then type <code>REISUO</code>, or <code>REISUB</code> to reboot. The SysRq key is the Print Screen key on most keyboards (on some laptops, it's Fn +Print, or Alt+Fn+Print)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's not a completely clean shutdown either (although it's good enough). I'm sorry to say I think that's as good as it gets at the moment.</p>\n",
