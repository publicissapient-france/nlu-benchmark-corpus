Unfortunately, it is Windows only and comes with a significant price tag. Without a great deal of customization, you will be hard-pressed to find a comparable solution. If you have the budget and run a heterogeneous shop, I can strongly recommend using this piece of software. Also, their IPAM and NetFlow tools are quite solid, as well.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I know of three pieces of software that run on Linux and might give you a start dynamically mapping your network: <a href=\"http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cheops</a>, <a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-performance-management.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OPManager</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OpenNMS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I would also recommend looking at the <a href=\"http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/nmtf/nmtf-tools.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SLAC page</a> to see if there are any more recent developments in the network management space.</p>\n\n<p>The following applications are listed, in ascending order, in terms of cost, complexity, and feature-sets. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cheops</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cheops is a free network mapping solution that will go out and discover and graphically display the servers and network nodes for you. It is old, and possibly no longer under development. But, it is a simple tool to use for network discovery.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/images/cheops.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/images/cheops.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>You can download Cheops, <a href=\"http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/download.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>OpenNMS</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpenNMS is able to do network discovery, event management, and performance management. It is available as a .deb package as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/w/images/a/a9/Example.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.opennms.org/w/images/a/a9/Example.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>Core features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic Layer-2 and Layer-3 link discovery</li>\n<li>Automatic Network / Node Discovery and Provisioning</li>\n<li>Automatic Service Discovery and Provisioning</li>\n<li>IPv6 support throughout (new)</li>\n<li>Manual Node and Service Provisioning Requisitions</li>\n<li>Path Outage support</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Features_List\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Feature list</a></p>\n\n<p>OpenNMS <a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">download</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Installation:Debian\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Installation instructions</a> for deb/apt-get.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPManager</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpManager, on the other hand, is a commercial tool. It has a similar feature-set of the SolarWinds solution. In my experience, it is very robust and customizable. That said, you will have to pay for it. It does run on Debian-based systems, though it is not custom-tailored for Ubuntu. YMMV.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/images/screenshot/network-mapping.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>In terms of network management functionality, it supports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Availability and Uptime Monitoring</li>\n<li>Traffic and Utilization Monitoring</li>\n<li>Cisco Monitoring</li>\n<li>Network Device Health Monitoring\n(Router, Switch, Firewall, wireless access points)</li>\n<li>Network Mapping</li>\n<li>Custom Network Maps / Network Traffic Maps</li>\n<li>WAN RTT Monitoring</li>\n<li>Network Traffic Analysis (NetFlow, sFlow)</li>\n<li>VoIP Monitoring</li>\n<li>Network Configuration Management</li>\n<li>IP Address Management</li>\n<li>Switch Port Mapper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For a full list of features, see:\n<a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/features.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>You can download a free trial of OPManager <a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/download.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>I would be very interested in hearing from others in regards to using a <strong>free</strong>, unified network management solution in Ubuntu that does not require in-house development and a great deal of care and feeding. </p>\n\n<p>In the mean time, when it's unreasonable to use OPManager, or OpenNMS, I will have to make due with my own custom Nagios/Cacti/SmokePing/Rancid/IPPlan solution for smaller networks.</p>\n",

For example Perl:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-perl prettyprint-override\"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl \nuse List::Util qw(min);\n\nsub levenshtein\n{\n    my ($str1, $str2) = @_;\n    my @ar1 = split //, $str1;\n    my @ar2 = split //, $str2;\n\n    my @dist;\n    $dist[$_][0] = $_ foreach (0 .. @ar1);\n    $dist[0][$_] = $_ foreach (0 .. @ar2);\n\n    foreach my $i (1 .. @ar1) {\n        foreach my $j (1 .. @ar2) {\n            my $cost = $ar1[$i - 1] eq $ar2[$j - 1] ? 0 : 1;\n            $dist[$i][$j] = min(\n                            $dist[$i - 1][$j] + 1, \n                            $dist[$i][$j - 1] + 1, \n                            $dist[$i - 1][$j - 1] + $cost\n                             );\n        }\n    }\n\n    return $dist[@ar1][@ar2];\n}\nopen(my $fh1, \"$ARGV[0]\");\nopen(my $fh2, \"$ARGV[1]\");\nchomp(my @strings1=&lt;$fh1&gt;);\nchomp(my @strings2=&lt;$fh2&gt;);\n\nforeach my $str1 (@strings1) {\n    foreach my $str2 (@strings2) {\n        my $lev=levenshtein($str1, $str2);\n        print \"$str1 / $str2 : $lev\\n\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As above, save the script as <code>~/bin/levenshtein.pl</code> and make it executable and run it with the two files as arguments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>~/bin/levenstein.pl fileA fileB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even in the very small files used here, the Perl approach is 10 times faster than the bash one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ time levenshtein.sh fileA fileB &gt; /dev/null\n\nreal    0m0.965s\nuser    0m0.070s\nsys     0m0.057s\n\n$ time levenshtein.pl fileA fileB &gt; /dev/null\nreal    0m0.011s\nuser    0m0.010s\nsys     0m0.000s\n</code></pre>\n",

So, if you have not done any tweaking with the permission of running the command just put the cron entry in the root user's cron (<code>sudo crontab -e</code>) or add the entry in <code>/etc/crontab</code> mentioning the user as root.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (Regarding Anacron):</strong> Absolutely bad idea. generally anacron is used while you want to run a command daily but you are not sure whether your computer will be On or Off. So lets say you have added an anacron entry to run a command. Then if the computer is On anacron checks and runs the command, if the computer was Off on that specified time the instant you turn On the computer next time anacron will run that command. </p>\n\n<p>So, in a nutshell anacron is used while you are not sure your computer is gonna be On or Off. In your case you are shutting down the computer so if you put that to run by anacron your computer will be shut down by anacron if it was off and when you will turn it On after the specified time. </p>\n\n<p>Your command</p>\n\n<pre><code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron || : 30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>means that run <code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron</code> first, if that fails run <code>30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now</code> makes no sense i think.

If you don't enter the password at POST the disk isn't exposed to the OS. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The disk lock is a built-in security feature in the disk. It is part\n  of the ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or\n  device. The disk lock can be enabled and disabled by sending special\n  ATA commands to the drive. If a disk is locked, it will refuse all\n  access until it is unlocked.</p>\n  \n  <p>A disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master\n  password.</p>\n  \n  <p>A disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum\n  security mode. In High security mode, the disk can be unlocked with\n  either the User or Master password. There is an attempt limit,\n  normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or\n  hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Maximum security mode, the disk can be unlocked only with the User\n  password. If the User password is not available, the only remaining\n  way to get at least the bare hardware back to a usable state is to\n  issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by\n  SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT\n  command requires the Master password and will completely erase all\n  data on the disk. The operation is slow, it may take longer than half\n  an hour or more, depending on the size of the disk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hard Disk imaging</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.clonezilla.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clonezilla</a> is an great tool to image HDDs and partitions, but I don't know if it can generate images from encrypted disks, but you can certainly clone the whole disk using <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/a/2725/65926\">dd</a>. A password locked HD won't be a problem since you'll unlock it prior image generation.</p>\n",

So I have to do it manually. Possibly if Ubuntu polishes and fixes the default installation method it may work in the future, as it was working by default in Ubuntu 13.04.</p>\n\n<p>I am connecting to the printer via USB. In a later version of this tutorial I will explain how to connect via LAN. </p>\n\n<p>I download these two files from the mentioned Brother's pages.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dcp8110dnlpr-3.0.0-1.i386.deb \ndcp8110dncupswrapper-3.0.0-1.i386.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In theory I can choose to install either the CUPS one or the LPR one. But it seems that if you choose to install the CUPS one, you have to install first the LPR one and then the CUPS one. And this is what I am going to describe, how to install both in order to get the CUPS driver to work. I am choosing CUPS as it is a more modern system. </p>\n\n<p>Procedure: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Install Apparmor utils (with sudo agt-get install apparmor-utils\nor with the Ubuntu software centre)</p>\n\n<p>sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's tell Apparmor (aa) not to complain (aa-complain) about CUPS\n(cupsd package)</p>\n\n<p>sudo aa-complain cupsd</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's create a directory necessary for the installation. But in my\ncase Ubuntu replied that the directory was already present.</p>\n\n<p>sudo mkdir /usr/share/cups/model</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's install the LPR driver (of course you need to navigate with\nthe command line to the folder where you have donwloaded the driver\nfile) (Quick tip: Use \"cd\" to navigate in the command line, example\n\"cd Documents\" to go to a subfolder called Documents inside your\npresent folder, or \"cd ..\" to go to an upper folder)</p>\n\n<p>sudo dpkg -i --force-all dcp8110dnlpr-3.0.0-1.i386.deb</p></li>\n<li><p>Install cupswrapper driver</p>\n\n<p>sudo dpkg -i --force-all dcp8110dncupswrapper-3.0.0-1.i386.deb</p></li>\n<li><p>Check if the LPR driver and cupswrapper driver are installed</p>\n\n<p>dpkg  -l  |  grep  Brother</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is the output I get in my computer for this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ii  dcp8110dcupswrapper                       3.0.0-1                                 i386         Brother DCP-8110D CUPS wrapper driver\nii  dcp8110dncupswrapper                      3.0.0-1                                 i386         Brother DCP-8110DN CUPS wrapper driver\nii  dcp8110dnlpr                              3.0.0-1                                 i386         Brother DCP-8110DN LPR driver\nii  printer-driver-ptouch                     1.3-6                                   i386         printer driver Brother P-touch label printers\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I am connecting to the printer via USB.
